This repo contains MATLAB files used in my chemical engineering course Reactor Analysis and Design. A vast majority of the files are used to calculate the conversion rates of the reactors. The most utilized method is numerical
intergration through the use of ode45, a Runge-Kutta 4 numerical integrator, along with plotting and graphical interpretation.
